# Security Fixes and Code Improvements

## Date: June 7, 2025

### Critical Security Fixes

1. **JWT Security Enhancement**
   - Replaced insecure mock JWT implementation with proper cryptographic JWT
   - Added secure token generation using HMAC-SHA256
   - Implemented token expiration and validation
   - File: `internal/auth/jwt.go` (new)

2. **Default Credentials Removed**
   - Removed hardcoded test/test and admin/admin accounts
   - File: `internal/auth/user_repo_memory.go`

3. **Connection Limits Added**
   - Maximum total connections: 1000
   - Maximum connections per IP: 5
   - Connection timeout: 5 minutes
   - File: `internal/network/tcp_server_pb.go`

4. **Input Validation**
   - Added block position validation with distance check (10 blocks radius)
   - Added block ID validation
   - Limited metadata size to 1KB
   - File: `internal/network/game_handler_pb.go`

### Performance & Stability Fixes

1. **Race Condition Fix**
   - Fixed entity manager race condition by holding lock during entire update
   - File: `internal/world/entity/manager.go`

2. **Message Size Validation**
   - Already properly implemented - validates before allocation

### Other Improvements

- Authentication bypass was already properly handled with return statements
- World manager double-checked locking was already correctly implemented

### Build Status
✅ All changes compile successfully
✅ All existing tests pass

### Recommendations for Future

1. Add rate limiting per user/IP
2. Implement proper logging and monitoring
3. Add comprehensive test coverage
4. Consider using TLS for network connections
5. Implement admin tools for user management
6. Add metrics collection for performance monitoring
